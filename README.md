InputDisplay
============

This program displays a controller and what inputs you do.  Any
controller works but you need to edit config.txt to make it display
the right things.  Right now you get n64 and xbox 360 controller
images.  I may add more later.

Run `cmake .` to create the makefiles that you need to compile the
program.  You also need SDL 2 and SDL_image 2.
