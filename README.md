InputDisplay
============
This program displays a controller and what inputs you do. Any controller works but you need to edit config.txt to make it display the right things. Right now you only get n64 controller images but I'll add more later.

Run `cmake .` to create the makefiles that you need to compile the program. You also need SDL libraries and headers.
